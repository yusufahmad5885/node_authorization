# node_authorization
Created a simple school administrative grading portal for students and teachers to see grades using express, node, js

# Summary of small project
* Created an api in express and built a user role system using middlewares 
* Used middlewares to authorize requests and grant permission to certain users <br />
&emsp; - For instance a teacher could see grades of all students, but a student could only see their grades <br />
&emsp; - Students only had access to their classes, not to all classes <br />
